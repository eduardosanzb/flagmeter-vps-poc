# FAQ Section
faq:
  title: "Frequently Asked Questions"
  subtitle: "Handling the objections, engineer to engineer"
  items:
    - question: "What if the VPS dies?"
      answer: "We run two instances with a floating IP. Cheaper than one EC2 with redundancy, and failover is automatic."
    - question: "How does this scale?"
      answer: "Vertical scaling gets you to 50k users easily. If you hit that, we add read replicas—not before. Most 'scale' problems are premature optimization."
    - question: "Won't investors freak out?"
      answer: "Hetzner is a €1B EU company with better uptime than most startups' AWS setups. This isn't a Pi under your desk—it's enterprise-grade infrastructure without the complexity tax."
    - question: "What about GDPR compliance?"
      answer: "All infrastructure stays in EU data centers. Hetzner is GDPR-compliant by default. We can provide data processing agreements if needed."
    - question: "How do you provide context without meetings?"
      answer: "Short Loom video + GitHub issue link. That's it. We read your code, ask questions in comments, and ship PRs. Most 'meetings' are just status updates we can async."
    - question: "What if we need emergency support?"
      answer: "Optional €500/mo gets you on our PagerDuty rotation for 90 days. After that, you shouldn't need us—but we're a DM away if you do."
    - question: "Do we have to use your tools?"
      answer: "No. We prefer GitHub for visibility, but we adapt to your workflow. The goal is to disappear into your existing process."
    - question: "What's the catch?"
      answer: "We're not a fit if you need multi-region failover today or think Kubernetes is 'simple.' This is for teams who want to ship features, not manage infrastructure."
