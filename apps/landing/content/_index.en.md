# FAQ Section
faq:
  title: "Frequently Asked Questions"
  subtitle: "Handling the objections, engineer to engineer"
  items:
    - question: "Why VPS over cloud?"
      answer: "VPS offers predictable costs and simplicity. We pair it with Cloudflare for edge cases (e.g., CDN, DDoS). No lock-in, no YAML hell."
    - question: "What about scaling?"
      answer: "Vertical scaling gets you to 50k users easily. If you hit that, we discuss read replicas—not before. Most 'scale' problems are premature optimization."
    - question: "Won’t investors freak out?"
      answer: "Hetzner is a €1B EU company with better uptime than most startups’ AWS setups. This isn’t a Pi under your desk—it’s enterprise-grade infrastructure."
    - question: "How do you ensure financial accountability?"
      answer: "We embed FinOps practices into your workflow, ensuring alignment between engineering decisions and business outcomes."
    - question: "Do we have to use your tools?"
      answer: "No. We adapt to your workflow. The goal is to disappear into your existing process."
